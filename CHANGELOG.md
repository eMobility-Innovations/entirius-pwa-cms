# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Optional SSO login** (login wall + `/sso/callback`): with
  `VUE_APP_SSO_API_BASE` set, the login wall offers "Log in with SSO". The CMS
  asks the backend for the provider's authorization URL, keeps the one-time
  `state` in `sessionStorage`, and on return exchanges the code for the same
  token pair the password login returns. Refresh and logout are unchanged. The
  CMS knows no identity provider, only two backend endpoints; contract in
  `docs/sso-login.md`. Unset, nothing changes.

### Changed

- **Post-login session setup is shared** (`src/composables/useLoginSession.js`):
  password and SSO login run the same code after the token call.

## [2.1.0] (2026-09-01)

### Added

- **Find product: grouped results** (`/atlas/find` and "Find in PIM"): hits split
  into *Exact matches* / *Similar* by the backend's `match` kind (django-lookup
  ≥ 0.2.0; `src/utils/lookupMatch.js` falls back on `similarity` for an older
  backend), `none` neighbours folded behind a disclosure, relevance shown as
  `NN %` with an "Exact" badge, and a photo-specific empty state.

### Security

- **Dependency refresh closing the open Dependabot alerts** (#23, #24, #25): unit-test
  toolchain (vitest 4, happy-dom 20, @vitejs/plugin-vue 6), runtime deps (axios 1.x,
  swiper 14, uuid 11, lodash, sass), and `package.json` `overrides` pinning the patched
  transitive vue-cli 5 / webpack 5 toolchain. Dependabot config added.
- **New CI job `test-e2e-mocked`**: backend-free Playwright smoke of the Atlas panels
  (cookie-stubbed auth, mocked APIs) on every PR.

### Fixed

- **Find product keeps its search across back-navigation**: opening a hit's
  details unmounted the view and wiped results, query and the uploaded photo —
  the operator had to re-upload the picture to inspect a second candidate. The
  last search now lives in the `lookupFind` store and is restored on return.

## [2.0.0] (2026-08-09)

First release from this repository — now the canonical home of the CMS.
The 1.x line was released from the previous internal repository (through
1.6.1); this release restores full feature parity with that line and adds
the changes below.

### Added

- **Multi-method payment rendering** (Checkout orders): `payment_method` is
  rendered as a list — a voucher settling alongside the gateway shows every
  method on the order detail. Orders holding the legacy single dict still
  render.
- **Voucher dormancy without the backend module**: the Promo panel now stays
  available when the backend lacks `checkout_voucher` — Discounts (served by
  `django-checkout`) remain usable, the Vouchers segment hides, voucher
  routes redirect to the panel root via the new `meta.module` route gating,
  and `?tab=vouchers` deep links land on a locked EmptyState.

### Fixed

- **Refresh token no longer clobbered**: when the backend does not rotate
  refresh tokens, the stored token is kept instead of being overwritten with
  `undefined` (users stayed logged in only until the first refresh).
- **Unit suite is self-contained**: `pretest:unit` generates `__client/`, so
  the suite passes in clean environments (CI).

### Changed

- **Documentation refactored to the handbook convention**: compact AGENTS.md
  plus a verified `docs/` reference set (panels/routing, stores/composables,
  UI components, testing, supplier bridges, gotchas, operator guides).
- **Repository identity**: package `entirius-pwa-cms` 2.0.0, MPL-2.0,
  pre-commit secret scanning, GitHub Actions CI.

## [1.6.1] (2026-07-22)

### Added

- **Delivery point type change** (Points panel): the Type dropdown is editable
  for custom points when the backend supports it (django-deliverypoints >=
  1.1.0, detected via the Munin module version — `isModuleAtLeast` in the munin
  store). Carrier points stay locked. Older backends keep the dropdown locked
  so a change is never silently dropped.
- **Order-impact warning on type creation**: creating a new delivery point type
  shows an informative notification that types are stored inside orders and
  cannot be changed or deleted later without developer assistance.

### Fixed

- **Point create no longer rejects empty optional fields**: `buildPayload`
  sent `null` for empty strings, which the create endpoint rejects ("Input
  should be a valid string" on 8 fields). Empty strings are sent as `""`,
  which also makes clearing a field on edit actually persist (PATCH `null`
  means "unchanged" on the backend).
- **No spurious "Unsaved changes" modal after creating a point**: the create
  path now snapshots the form before redirecting, and `useUnsavedChanges`
  recomputes `isDirty` when the snapshot baseline changes (watch covered only
  `current` before, so `snapshot()` after save never reset the dirty flag —
  affects all 9 views using the composable).
- **Translations section hidden on single-language setups** (Point detail):
  nothing to translate into when channels expose one language; the section
  still shows if legacy translations exist.

## [1.6.0] (2026-07-02)

### Fixed

- **Real API error messages reach the operator everywhere** (fixes a regression
  where empty error toasts were shown): the token-refresh interceptor rejects non-401 errors with
  the unwrapped response body, so every view-level `err.response?.data` read
  was dead code and the operator got a generic "Something went wrong" toast
  instead of the backend message. All ~195 ad-hoc handlers across every panel
  (PIM, Points, Faq, Authors, Agreements, Emails, ContactForms, Accounts,
  CheckoutOrders, LayoutExtenders, PriceManager, Promo, Suppliers, Stock,
  Enrichment) now go through `extractApiMessage(err, fallback)`.
- **`useFormErrors` understands every backend error shape**: v2 envelope,
  legacy `{detail}` (string and pydantic list), DRF-in-envelope
  `{meta, data: {field: [msg]}}` and raw DRF `{field: [msg]}` — wrapped and
  unwrapped — with a guaranteed non-empty per-field message.
- **No more empty error UI**: `BasicInput` renders the error line only with a
  non-empty message, `spawnNotification` falls back to a localized message on
  an empty toast (and unwraps refs — `formErrors.summary` passed raw is a
  ComputedRef, always truthy, which silently defeated `||` fallbacks).
- **Promo custom error parsers removed**: `filterErrorMessage`,
  `codeErrorMessage` and the `extractError` helpers now delegate to
  `extractApiMessage`; `handleApiError` re-wrap workarounds dropped.

### Added

- **Promo panel**: full discount/voucher management — discount rules
  with modifiers and per-rule discount codes (`PromoList`/`PromoEdit`),
  campaigns, vouchers (list, detail with code reveal, product vouchers),
  product/threshold/customer filter drawer, and per-channel promo settings.
  Ships a new `promo` + `voucher` API client pair and a `checkoutChannel`
  store; order list gained discount/voucher context.
- **AI translations**: bulk product translation in PIM
  (`TranslateDialog`, `TranslateStoreDialog`), translate-all for content
  (`TranslateAllContentModal` in Builder), and a Translation Dashboard for
  monitoring jobs (`translationJobs` store + `pim`/`contentDB` translator API
  clients). Both the translate actions and the Promo panel are gated on their
  backend modules being enabled (Munin).
- **`Dropdown` field-error support**: new `validate` prop (`{status, msg}`,
  same shape as `BasicInput`) renders an invalid border + message; used for
  the feature-set picker on Product create. `TextAreaBasic` unified to the
  same `{status, msg}` shape.
- **Error-feedback e2e suite** (`tests/e2e/16-error-feedback.spec.js`): live
  required-field and duplicate-SKU scenarios plus six mocked backend error
  shapes (v2, DRF envelope, raw DRF, `{detail}`, 500 HTML, network abort)
  assert the operator always sees a concrete, non-empty message.

## [1.5.2] (2026-06-25)

### Fixed

- **Layout-extender publish persists the draft first**: publishing a
  layout-extender now saves the pending draft before the publish call, so the
  published layout reflects the latest edits instead of the last saved state.
- **Category links now point to real storefront pages**: the category picker
  (`useCategoryFetch`) saves the category `url_key` into `link_value` instead of
  `idx`. Affects every storefront-routing picker -- megamenu items, banners,
  links, and FAQ associations. Previously, categories whose `idx` differed from
  their `url_key` produced catalog links that resolved to zero products. Falls
  back to `idx` when the backend doesn't yet supply `url_key` (requires
  django-pim with the `url_key` field on the admin category list). Internal PIM
  pickers (product-to-category assignment, supplier mapping) keep using `idx`
  and are unaffected.

## [1.1.0] (2026-03-03)

### WYSIWYG Editor Improvements

- **Paste sanitization**: Strip inline `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `background-color`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing` from pasted HTML via `transformPastedHTML`. Toolbar color button still works -- only paste-time styles are removed.
- **Focus mode**: Distraction-free writing via `<Teleport to="body">`. Blurred backdrop, centered card (z-201, above HandyKit), Escape to close, body scroll lock. Expand/compress button in top-right corner of editor (appears on hover, always visible in focus mode).
- **Line-height**: Set to 1.7 for body text, 1.3 for headings, 1.4 for table cells. Applied to both editor and preview.
- **Cursor**: `cursor: text` on `.ProseMirror` in normal mode.
- **Icons**: Registered `faExpand` and `faCompress` in FA icon library.
- **Dark mode cleanup**: Removed `!important` color override from editor (paste sanitization handles it). Kept override in Builder.vue for legacy saved content in read-only previews.
